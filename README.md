# Insight Write Journaling Application <br/> (Software Engineering)
Welcome! For our Software Engineering final project, my team and I collaborated to create Insight Write 📒📝, a Django web application built with Python. Designed to offer a unique journaling experience, our project aims to serve individuals interested in personal growth and self-expression. Insight Write provides a private and supportive space for users to reflect and improve their mental health.
